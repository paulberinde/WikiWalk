## Description
WikiWalk is an application that combines a Google Maps view with data from the Dutch National Monuments (Rijksmonumenten) API, as well as relevant information from Wikipedia.

By using the app during a visit to Amsterdam, or a simple walk across town, you can discover lesser-known monuments with ease. Use the map to guide you to the nearest monument.

 Once you are in range (50 meters or less) the application will automatically unlock a Collection entry about the monument, which you can consult. This Collection entry contains the name of the Monument, its address, its category, and if it exists, a link to the related Wikipedia Article.

Due to the nature of the data sources in use, the app is currently only available in Dutch.
