# Day 1

Day 1 was spent doing initial research on APIs for Google Maps and Wikipedia, as well as formalizing the application concept. The concept, along
with further documentation and some concept screens have been uploaded as the project proposal, after discussion with the TAs.
One interesting discovery made during the day was the application JustinMind Prototyper, which can be used for easy prototyping.

Three logo versions have also been created:
